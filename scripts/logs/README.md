## Retention & Persistence

**Logs are APPEND-ONLY and NEVER automatically deleted:**

- ✅ Each operation appends to the daily log file
- ✅ Old logs are preserved indefinitely
- ✅ New day = new log file (daily rotation)
- ❌ Logs are NEVER cleared or overwritten

To clean up logs manually (if needed):

```powershell
# Delete all logs older than 7 days
Get-ChildItem scripts/logs/*.log | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) } | Remove-Item

# Delete all logs (use with caution!)
Remove-Item scripts/logs/*.log
```

## Note

Log files are git-ignored and will not be committed to the repository.
