# Active Context

## Current Status
Project initialization. The PRD has been defined, and we are setting up the project structure and OpenSpec proposal.

## Recent Changes
*   Created `memory-bank` documentation.
*   Read `docs/PRD.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Active Decisions
*   **Change ID**: `init-channel-verification-bot` chosen for the OpenSpec proposal.
*   **Capability Name**: `channel-guard` to encapsulate verification and enforcement logic.
*   **Tech Stack Choice**: Python with `python-telegram-bot` is the primary candidate based on PRD recommendation, but Node.js is an option. Will follow user preference or default to Python if unspecified.

## Next Steps
1.  Create OpenSpec proposal (`init-channel-verification-bot`).
2.  Define `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md`.
3.  Define Spec Deltas for `channel-guard`.
4.  Validate proposal.
5.  Wait for User Approval.
