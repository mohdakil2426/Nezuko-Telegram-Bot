# Project Brief: Nezuko

## Overview
Nezuko is the ultimate all-in-one Telegram bot designed to empower community managers with a growing suite of multi-talented features. Beginning with production-grade channel enforcement, it is built to scale into a comprehensive platform for group management, growth, and interaction.

## Core Goals
1.  **Automated Membership Enforcement**: Intercept group interactions and immediately restrict users who haven't joined the required channel(s).
2.  **Premium User Experience**: Provide intuitive, interactive guidance via inline keyboards and personalized messaging to help users verify their status with a single click.
3.  **Scalable Multi-Tenancy**: Support hundreds of independent group-channel pairs from a single bot instance using database-driven configuration.
4.  **Operational Excellence**: Maintain high performance (<100ms latency) and reliability through advanced caching, rate limiting, and observability.

## Value Proposition
*   **For Admins**: Instant, zero-config growth for Telegram channels by converting group participants into subscribers.
*   **For Users**: Clear, non-intrusive verification flows that don't disrupt the community experience once completed.
