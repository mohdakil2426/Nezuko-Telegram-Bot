# Project Brief

## Project Name
Telegram Channel Verification Bot (Force Subscribe Bot)

## Overview
A Telegram bot that enforces channel membership as a prerequisite for sending messages in a linked discussion group. Users who are not subscribers of a specific channel are automatically muted in the group until they join.

## Core Goals
1.  **Enforce Membership**: Automatically mute group members who are not subscribed to the target channel.
2.  **User Guidance**: Provide clear instructions and a link to join the channel when a user is restricted.
3.  **Easy Verification**: Allow users to re-verify their status with a single click after joining.
4.  **Admin Convenience**: Automate the policing of group members to drive channel growth.

## Scope
*   **Target Users**: Group Administrators and Group Members.
*   **Platform**: Telegram (Mobile & Desktop).
*   **Key Function**: Restrict text/media permissions for non-subscribers.
